            </h3>
            <p>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, the first of seven autobiographical works by American writer Maya Angelou, published in 1969. The book chronicles her life from age 3 through age 16, recounting an unsettled and sometimes traumatic childhood that included rape and racism. It became one of the most widely read and taught books written by an African American woman.</p>

            <h3>
                And Still I Rise
            </h3>
            <p>"Still I Rise" is an empowering poem about the struggle to overcome prejudice and injustice. It is one of Maya Angelou's most famous and popular poems. When read by victims of wrongdoing, the poem becomes a kind of anthem, a beacon of hope for the oppressed and downtrodden.</p>
            <p>It is a reminder of the abuses of power by those who sit in government, the judiciary, the military, and the police force. For members of the public, it sends out a clear, repeated message of hope. No matter the circumstances, there must always be hope to cling to.</p>
