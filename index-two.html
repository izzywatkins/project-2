                The Raven
            </h3>
            <p>The Raven, best-known poem by Edgar Allan Poe, published in 1845 and collected in The Raven and Other Poems the same year. Poe achieved instant national fame with the publication of this melancholy evocation of lost love.</p>
            <p>On a stormy December midnight, a grieving student is visited by a raven who speaks but one word, “Nevermore.” As the student laments his lost love Lenore, the raven’s insistent repetition of the word becomes an increasingly harrowing response to the student’s own fears and longing.</p>
